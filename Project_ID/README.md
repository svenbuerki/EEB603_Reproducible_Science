# Content of the project

The content of this project is as follows:

- The `data` folder contains all input data (and metadata) used in the analysis.
- The `MS` folder contains the manuscript.
- The `Figures_&_Tables` folder contains figures and tables generated by the analyses.
- The `Output` folder contains any type of intermediate or output files (e.g. simulation outputs, models, processed datasets, etc.). You might separate this and also have a `cleaned-data` folder.
- The `R_functions` folder contains R scripts with function definitions.
- The `Reports` folder contains RMarkdown files that document the analysis or report on results.
- The scripts (`*.R`) that actually do things are stored in the root directory together with the `README.md` file.
